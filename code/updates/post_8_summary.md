# Post 8: Single Model Limitations and Project Kickoff

## Overview
In Post 8, we introduced the limitations of using a single model to analyze complex events, like the Syria conflict.  
The key takeaway: events are layered, interconnected, and require a more comprehensive approach.

We also shared a **visual representation** of this complexity. The illustration highlights the three core components of our framework:  
1. **Truth**: Perspectives, biases, and narratives.  
2. **Origin**: Historical context and unintended consequences.  
3. **Complexity**: Actions, reactions, and interdependencies.  

## GitHub Progress
1. **Repository Created**:  
   - The **Project RootSource** repository has been initialized with a `README.md`.  
   - The README outlines the project's purpose and invites contributions.  

2. **Initial Framework Folder Added**:  
   - A folder named `code/` has been created to store all upcoming code files.  
   - The first file, `framework_start.py`, will serve as the base for building the system.

3. **Visuals Uploaded**:  
   - The Syria framework illustration is available under `visuals/syria_framework.png`.  
   - This image demonstrates why single models fall short in capturing real-world complexity.

## Next Steps
- Begin implementing the **Truth Layer** in `framework_start.py`.  
- Show how perspectives and biases can be represented in the code.  
- Share progress and code updates in Post 9.
