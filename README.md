# Project RootSource

Welcome to **Project RootSource**, a step-by-step framework for understanding and analyzing misinformation during complex events.  

This repository is the beginning of an experiment – one that aims to uncover patterns, roots, and the truth behind misinformation.  

### Current Progress

## Syria Complexity Framework

This visualization demonstrates the limitations of using a single model to analyze complex events, such as the Syria conflict.  
It highlights the three critical layers of the analysis:  

1. **Truth**: Perspectives, biases, and narratives.  
2. **Origin**: Historical context and unintended consequences.  
3. **Complexity**: Actions, reactions, and interdependencies.

### Truth Layer - Perspectives and Biases
The Truth Layer is the first part of the framework. It analyzes different perspectives and biases that shape our understanding of events.

**Included Perspectives:**
1. Government Narrative
2. Opposition Narrative
3. International Media Perspective

**Biases Addressed:**
- Hidden Agendas
- Media Spin
- Cultural Contexts
- Selective Reporting

To see the implementation, check out the [truth_layer.py](code/truth_layer.py) file.

#### What’s Next?
The next step will focus on integrating the **Origin Layer** to analyze historical contexts and unintended consequences.
